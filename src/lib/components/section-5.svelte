    <p class="mb-4">
        I conduct qualitative market research,
        specializing in applications for immunotherapies
        and other novel mechanisms of action in solid
        tumor oncology. My skillset combines business
        consulting, behavioral psychology,
        biochemistry, and objective interaction
        management to learn nuanced insights from
        healthcare professionals.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        This allows respondents to see me as a
        credible, objective, and empathetic interviewer,
        which facilitates our ability to build a deeper
        shared understanding of their priorities,
        motivations, and concerns.
